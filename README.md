# sprint-1_improved
This is the same sprint-1 project with some improvements suggested by the evaluator.the improvements made are

1.the password appears as xxxxxxx during login insted of plain text

2.Made corrections in the object names according to naming conventions

3.initial data was fed from the Dao layer hence corrected it

4.corrected the test cases which tests custom exceptions in the code.


NOTE:this program is to be run from command line only as it gives NullPointerException during password intake from any IDE .
